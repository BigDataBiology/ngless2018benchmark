# NGLess Benchmarking

This repository includes code for benchmarking [ngless](http://ngless.rtfd.io).

## Reproducing


### From scratch

1. Download all data: run the script `download-data.py`. This will download
from ENA into a directory `data/` (this process can take a few hours and will
result in ca. 50GiB of data).
