# Benchmark human filtering

You need to have [Jug](https://jug.readthedocs.io/) and
[NGLessPy](https://github.com/ngless-toolkit/nglesspy) installed.

Then running `jug execute` will create the graph in the paper. If you have
multiple processors, running multiple instances of `jug execute` will produce
results faster.
